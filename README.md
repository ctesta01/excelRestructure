OIRE Projects Restructure-er
============================

This is a python script and VBA macro written to restructure a document called OIREProjects.csv (not listed here). This is the same as a Tableau restructure command (an extension to Excel), but rebuilt using only VBA and Python. 

The python script is included to be able to run this as a scheduled event. Additionally, the macro closes the relevant workbooks and python closes Excel if there are no other open workbooks.
